sc.0.Adaptable.suggestions.lo=Resisting change is natural and totally human. However, change is also inevitable and in our complex world it seems to be happening faster and faster. Accepting change as the norm is the first step to becoming more adaptable. Next, learn to recognize when change is happening. Let it trigger a new thought process that allows you to deal with change as change. When you actually recognize that you're being affected by change, you can then apply any of the following techniques:
sc.0.Adaptable.suggestions.lo.b1=Ask some new and different questions that let you explore what's really happening with an open mind.
sc.0.Adaptable.suggestions.lo.b2=Force yourself to try out several different perspectives before you decide on any one point of view.
sc.0.Adaptable.suggestions.lo.b3=Step back and view the big picture. This often helps you see change as somewhat less significant and disturbing - so you can think.

sc.0.Adaptable.suggestions.hi=Some people live for change. They see what's currently normal as boring and spend a great deal of time devising or trying out new ways of doing things. they truly embrace the aphorism: Change is good. However, being too adaptable can be counter-productive in work situations, and it can lead to boredom when work becomes repetitive. If you thrive on change, it's not easy to change that. However, there are a few things you can do to prevent it from hindering your work performance and career:
sc.0.Adaptable.suggestions.hi.b1=Learn to allocate a certain amount of time to finding a better way to do something. When that time is up, choose your path and go. 
sc.0.Adaptable.suggestions.hi.b2=Recognize when you are involved in a task or project that is likely to be repetitive. Set goals for production or results and focus on those as a way to keep your interest.
sc.0.Adaptable.suggestions.hi.b3=Catch yourself when you want to discuss a project or task with your boss, but you see your boss is far more interested in just getting the work done. Save your questioning/brainstorming time with the boss for really good ideas only.

sc.1.Analytical+Thinking.suggestions.lo=Despite what you may believe, we all learn our analytical skills - through both our education and our work. Like a muscle, they improve with practice. Even if you're no longer in school, there are many things you can do to practice and improve, including:
sc.1.Analytical+Thinking.suggestions.lo.b1=Work out match problems.  Either identify common problems in everyday life and take the time to solve them, or enroll in a college level math course. 
sc.1.Analytical+Thinking.suggestions.lo.b2=Play brain games. Crossword puzzles, Soduku, riddles, logic puzzles, or strategy-oriented board and video games. 
sc.1.Analytical+Thinking.suggestions.lo.b3=Join a debating club, discussion club, or a book club. 

sc.1.Attention+to+Detail.suggestions.lo=Not everybody is a detail person, but everyone can improve their level of attention to details at work with a few simple strategies:
sc.1.Attention+to+Detail.suggestions.lo.b1=Create a to-do list every day, and look at it frequently. Let yourself enjoy checking off the boxes every time you accomplish something.
sc.1.Attention+to+Detail.suggestions.lo.b2=Ask colleagues or friends to check your work - seriously. Appreciate what they find or point out, and ask yourself why you didn't notice those things yourself.
sc.1.Attention+to+Detail.suggestions.lo.b3=Reduce your distractions. Close your door, forward your phone, don't look at email. Find a way to ignore all the noise that consumes our focus for so much of the day.
sc.1.Attention+to+Detail.suggestions.lo.b4=Take a break - a good one - then check your work. Even if you feel you've nailed something, it's always worthwhile to wait a short time, then look at it again. It's tempting to just send it off as soon as it looks complete, but one simple check step can go a tremendous way, and prevent you from showing some embarrassing mistakes to your boss!

sc.0.Competitive.suggestions.lo=Studies have shown that a certain amount of competitiveness at work generally results in higher performance. Being too competitive can hurt your performance in many jobs, but so can not being competitive enough. Non-competitive people are willing to do just about anything for the good of their team, which is a great thing. However, a lack of competitive spirit can indicate a lack of motivation in certain situations. Here are a few things you can do to ensure that you keep some competitive spirit alive at work, without it becoming a problem:
sc.0.Competitive.suggestions.lo.b1=Compete against yourself. Set goals for yourself, and work to beat them. Your boss may establish goals for you, but maintain your own list.
sc.0.Competitive.suggestions.lo.b2=Tell yourself it's not about winning against someone else. It's about doing the best you can do. You don't have to need to win, but you should desire to be superb at what you do. 

sc.0.Competitive.suggestions.hi=Being too competitive can be damaging at work because it often places the organization's goals behind your own, or it can lead to behaviors that trample the efforts of others. However, it doesn't have to be that way. Being competitive is a wonderful thing, as long as it manifests itself in a productive way. If you know you are a competitive person, you can limit the collateral damage using the following techniques:
sc.0.Competitive.suggestions.hi.b1=Give yourself adequate time to achieve your goals. Take a little pressure off, and you'll give yourself more time to consider the others around you.
sc.0.Competitive.suggestions.hi.b2=Set realistic goals for yourself. Don't reach too far, too quickly. Take a more methodical approach.
sc.0.Competitive.suggestions.hi.b3=Recognize when your actions will have a negative affect on others. See your actions from their perspective - before you do it. If you sense a negative reaction, stop and think twice before you move forward. If you still end up impacting someone else, do whatever it takes to make it right.
sc.0.Competitive.suggestions.hi.b4=Be willing to fully and freely admit your mistakes and shortcomings, and take positive actions to fix them. 
sc.0.Competitive.suggestions.hi.b5=Be proud of the accomplishments of others. Highly competitive people are often threatened by others who meet their goals. Learn to recognize that 'threatened' feeling and ask yourself why you feel that way, then help that person celebrate - sincerely.

sc.0.Corporate+Citizenship.suggestions.lo=Being a good corporate citizen means placing the needs of your organization above your own needs. This means understanding the spirit and intent of the organization's mission and objectives, and making decisions that are consistent with that intent. Here are some things to think about or do:
sc.0.Corporate+Citizenship.suggestions.lo.b1=Ensure you fully understand the company's mission statement, vision, and corporate objectives. If there is a values statement, be sure you read it and understand it. 
sc.0.Corporate+Citizenship.suggestions.lo.b2=Volunteer for activities that contribute to the general functioning of the organization. For instance, you can organize the company holiday party, represent the company at a recruiting fair, or plan a town hall meeting or forum to address an issue related to the company mission. 
sc.0.Corporate+Citizenship.suggestions.lo.b3=At town hall and other group meetings, ask questions relating to the companies overall mission and objectives, rather than about things that mostly impact you or a small group of employees.

sc.0.Develops+Relationships.suggestions.lo=Developing relationships is a core part of almost every job. Work is accomplished by people. While there are jobs out there that don't directly require a lot of interaction or collaboration with others, virtually every career depends on a certain amount of interaction and/or collaboration. Here are some things you can do to improve your ability to nurture and grow relationships:
sc.0.Develops+Relationships.suggestions.lo.b1=Force yourself to network with peers both inside and outside your company. It's not easy, but developing a large professional network is truly invaluable.
sc.0.Develops+Relationships.suggestions.lo.b2=Improve your people skills. It's hard to feel confident meeting others if you don't feel that you're good with people. There are many short courses and books that can help. Or you can simply observe others. 
sc.0.Develops+Relationships.suggestions.lo.b3=Learn to appreciate others, and let them know it. Nothing cements a solid personal relationship like a feeling of appreciation. There is good in everyone. Learn to look for it, and then reflect it back. 
sc.0.Develops+Relationships.suggestions.lo.b4=Become a great listener. The best way to let people know that we hear them is to make sure that we first understand what they are saying.
sc.0.Develops+Relationships.suggestions.lo.b5=Remember things that are important to others. Just remembering someone's name can work wonders. People love to talk about what's important to them. 

sc.0.Develops+Relationships.suggestions.hi=While relationships are a key aspect of any job, it is possible to care so much about how others may feel that your work suffers or critical information doesn't get shared efficiently and in time to make a difference. There's no point in trying to be less of a people person. However, the key is to make sure you are focused enough on the mission of the organization and your role so that your desire to build relationships doesn't interfere with your work. Some things to consider/do:
sc.0.Develops+Relationships.suggestions.hi.b1=Learn to recognize signs that someone else wants to get back to work. Does their body language suggest they are becoming impatient? Do they keep looking away or towards their desk or computer. Have they gone silent? when you see these signs, be sure to back off quickly.
sc.0.Develops+Relationships.suggestions.hi.b2=Limit your socializing time during work hours. Be the first person to 'get back to it' when you have an informal discussion. Don't be the last.
sc.0.Develops+Relationships.suggestions.hi.b3=Balance the needs of others with the needs of your job. Sometimes, you have to put your work first, even if it annoys a co-worker. Learn to be diplomatic but firm. Don't be afraid to come back later and apologize, even if it's not really necessary. 


sc.4.Emotional+Self-Awareness.suggestions.lo=Learning to become more aware of your emotions can be a valuable asset in your career. It can prevent you from making decisions at the wrong time, or from saying the wrong thing at a bad time. The key is to become more in touch with yourself. This takes effort, but it can be done. Here are some activities you can do:
sc.4.Emotional+Self-Awareness.suggestions.lo.b1=Read about or join a group to practice meditation or mindfulness.
sc.4.Emotional+Self-Awareness.suggestions.lo.b2=Use a notebook to record your feelings a few times a day. Asking yourself this question in a disciplined way will trigger greater self-awareness.
sc.4.Emotional+Self-Awareness.suggestions.lo.b3=When you are feeling strong emotions, don't deflect them or avoid them. As many Buddhist gurus suggest, lean into them. Allow yourself to feel the emotion for a short period and truly become familiar with it. 
 

sc.4.Emotional+Self-Control.suggestions.lo=Failing to control yourself when you are emotional is a sure recipe for limited career advancement. If you tend to act impulsively, here are some things you can do:
sc.4.Emotional+Self-Control.suggestions.lo.b1=Always stop to look at the big picture. When you manage to look at a problem from a long distance, it often doesn't seem so big or threatening anymore. 
sc.4.Emotional+Self-Control.suggestions.lo.b2=Breathe. You hear it again and again. Count to 10 before you speak. Sleep on it first. Whatever it is, find a way to exercise patience before you act. 
sc.4.Emotional+Self-Control.suggestions.lo.b3=Exercise as regularly as possible. A regular short period of exercise can be more valuable than sporadic long duration sessions.

sc.4.Empathy.suggestions.lo=Empathy is simply recognizing emotions in others, and being able to "put yourself in another person's shoes" \u2013 understanding the other person's perspective and reality. Empathetic individuals establish stronger relationships and trust with the people they interact with. In the workplace, this capability and the stronger relationships they can nurture, often produce better results. Here are some ways to improve your ability to empathize:
sc.4.Empathy.suggestions.lo.b1=Force yourself to put your viewpoint aside, at least for a moment or two. This will enable you to see things from the other person's point of view. If they are feeling pain, sadness, happiness, or another emotion, you should be able to feel it too.
sc.4.Empathy.suggestions.lo.b2=Validate or affirm the other person's perspective in words. Just trying to articulate what the other person is feeling will help you understand it better. Plus, right or wrong, it will also show the other person you care enough about the way they feel to understand it. 
sc.4.Empathy.suggestions.lo.b3=Listen listen listen. With your ears, your yes, and your own feelings. People communicate in more ways than just verbally. If you can "hear" them in all dimensions, you'll be far more likely to understand how they feel. 

sc.0.Enjoys+Problem-Solving.suggestions.lo=Problems exist everywhere. No matter what your job, you will encounter problems you need to solve. Why not embrace each one as a chance to apply yourself and do good? If you want to improve your problem-solving ability, here are some things you can do:
sc.0.Enjoys+Problem-Solving.suggestions.lo.b1=Remain objective. Don't allow your emotions to interfere and push you towards an invalid conclusion or assumption and thus an ineffective solution. 
sc.0.Enjoys+Problem-Solving.suggestions.lo.b2=List the obstacles and describe the problem you are trying to solve before identifying solutions. 
sc.0.Enjoys+Problem-Solving.suggestions.lo.b3=Open up to open-minded people. The best solutions almost always come from groups of open-minded people. 
sc.0.Enjoys+Problem-Solving.suggestions.lo.b4=Be sure to cast your ego aside. It doesn't matter who gets the credit or who thought of what. What matters is choosing the very best solution. 


sc.0.Exhibits+a+Positive+Work+Attitude.suggestions.lo=We all have ups and downs. But our attitude usually speaks so loudly that co-workers and other people can't hear what we are actually saying. There are often other issues behind a negative attitude that cannot be solved easily. However, there are a few easy things you can do to offset minor issues you may be experiencing, such as:
sc.0.Exhibits+a+Positive+Work+Attitude.suggestions.lo.b1=Always act with a purpose in mind. If you can't clearly tell someone what the purpose of any activity is, take it off your to-do list. 
sc.0.Exhibits+a+Positive+Work+Attitude.suggestions.lo.b2=Take action without expecting any specific results. It can be very disappointing if we expect something to happen every time we do something and it doesn't happen. Certainly, we may need to do something differently next time. But the good news is we're getting closer, since we're learning what doesn't work. Avoid the disappointment by focusing on the progress you are making, even if it's in the school of hard knocks. 
sc.0.Exhibits+a+Positive+Work+Attitude.suggestions.lo.b3=Don't take yourself too seriously. Be able to laugh at yourself and do it. 
sc.0.Exhibits+a+Positive+Work+Attitude.suggestions.lo.b4=Forgive the limitations of others. Intolerance gets you nowhere. When you accept that nobody is perfect, you become more accepting of others, and they will become more accepting of you. 


sc.0.Expressive+and+Outgoing.suggestions.lo=Sharing opinions, ideas, and feelings is easy for some people and more difficult for others. However, if you want to get your ideas across, or simply form better relationships with your co-workers, try one or more of these suggestions:
sc.0.Expressive+and+Outgoing.suggestions.lo.b1=Use more body language. You can use hand gestures to help get your point across. It doesn't have to be wild gyrations, but any movement increases the energy of your statement.
sc.0.Expressive+and+Outgoing.suggestions.lo.b2=Meet face-to-face when you can. Nothing substitutes for a face to face meeting. If you want to make sure you are both communicating clearly get in the same room. If you can't do that, a phone call or video call is the next best thing. The key is not to remove the visual aspect of communication.
sc.0.Expressive+and+Outgoing.suggestions.lo.b3=Learn to express your thoughts and feelings concisely. Boil it down to the shortest number of words possible. When you speak concisely and succinctly, people tend to hear you better, since they don't have as much to process. 

sc.0.Expressive+and+Outgoing.suggestions.hi=Sharing opinions, ideas, and feelings is very easy for some people. However, you can go too far and be so expressive that people tune you out. 
sc.0.Expressive+and+Outgoing.suggestions.hi.b1=Be conscious of your talking time when you have the floor. Don't dominate every conversation. Allow others at least equal time. 
sc.0.Expressive+and+Outgoing.suggestions.hi.b2=Focus on listening, not speaking. It may not come naturally, but a good listener earns trust faster than anyone else.



sc.140.History+Survey+-+Performance.suggestions.lo=Your answers to some of the questions indicate that you may have habits that could impact your performance on the job. You may want to consider changing some of these habits. Some suggestions:
sc.140.History+Survey+-+Performance.suggestions.lo.b1=Apply for any awards that may be available. 
sc.140.History+Survey+-+Performance.suggestions.lo.b2=Volunteer for extra work or projects if available. 
sc.140.History+Survey+-+Performance.suggestions.lo.b3=Take your performance reviews seriously. These often provide clear feedback on any performance issues your manager or team leader has observed. By taking corrective action and avoiding repeat issues, you can significantly improve your performance rating over time.
sc.140.History+Survey+-+Performance.suggestions.lo.b4=Invest in yourself by enrolling in training or educational programs to learn new skills - before your manager asks you to do so. 

sc.140.History+Survey+-+Tenure.suggestions.lo=Your answers to some of the questions indicate you may be likely to leave a job voluntarily after only a short period of work. Employers don't expect you to stay forever, but they do expect you to stay with them long enough for them to recoup any investment they've made in time, training, or other resources to ready you for performing the work. 

sc.0.Innovative+and+Creative.suggestions.lo=Not everyone is an artist. It's true. But anyone can be creative at work. It just takes a commitment to explore a situation of problem for new ideas. There are multiple techniques anyone can use, including:
sc.0.Innovative+and+Creative.suggestions.lo.b1=Force yourself to identify a couple new ideas, even if you end up choosing the old one. Don't worry if the new idea isn't feasible or practical. What matters is that it's something you hadn't thought of before. 
sc.0.Innovative+and+Creative.suggestions.lo.b2=Manage your time - by making time to think outside the box. Don't worry if nothing comes, but be disciplined and at least try. 
sc.0.Innovative+and+Creative.suggestions.lo.b3=Find a group of open-minded, accepting people to brainstorm with. They don't have to be experts, but they have to be participants. Your mantra: there are no bad ideas.

sc.0.Needs+Structure.suggestions.lo=Some people need to feel there is structure in their life, while others just want to be free to do what they think is best. There's nothing wrong with either. However, if you have little or no need for a structured work environment, be considerate of those that do. 
sc.0.Needs+Structure.suggestions.lo.b1=Empathize with others who clearly need more structure, so at least they know you understand. 

sc.0.Needs+Structure.suggestions.hi=It's OK to need structure in your work environment, as long as it doesn't paralyze you when things get a little crazy. 
sc.0.Needs+Structure.suggestions.hi.b1=Be careful to select a job where you can have the level of structure you need. 
sc.0.Needs+Structure.suggestions.hi.b2=Ask for specific instructions when you feel you need them. Don't allow yourself to sit at your desk paralyzed for lack of knowing what to do. 


# sc.0.Seeks+Perfection.suggestions.lo=THIS IS LOW ATTENTION TO DETAIL

sc.0.Seeks+Perfection.suggestions.hi=Being too much of a perfectionist can seriously impact your performance on the job by causing you to take too long to get anything done. We all want to do a good job and no one wants to submit work that has errors in it, but the system works best when everyone finds a balance between meeting deadlines and other time expectations, and making sure there are no errors. 
sc.0.Seeks+Perfection.suggestions.hi.b1=Find the line. Know the difference between healthy and neurotic perfectionism. Get a feel for what is "Good Enough."
sc.0.Seeks+Perfection.suggestions.hi.b2=If you're worried something isn't perfect, just tell the person you pass it on to and offer to review it some more. This way, they know you aren't absolutely sure it's perfect, and you've given them the choice to accept it "as is" or ask for more from you. 


sc.142.Writing.suggestions.lo=The capability to write is a core skill for many different jobs, though not all jobs. If the jobs that interest you involve writing, you might consider some of the following actions:
sc.142.Writing.suggestions.lo.b1=Read more. Reading is one of the best ways to improve your ability to write. It can also be fun. Read the material you like - so you'll read more of it. Don't be afraid to try different authors and styles as well.
sc.142.Writing.suggestions.lo.b2=When you need to write something, eliminate any distractions. You cannot write and do something else at the same time. It takes all of your focus. 
sc.142.Writing.suggestions.lo.b3=If you don't understand basic grammar, such as what makes up a good sentence, take some time to learn it. 
sc.142.Writing.suggestions.lo.b4=Increase your vocabulary. If you don't understand a word you just read, look it up in a dictionary. Modern electronic devices let you do this with a double click. 

sc.150.Multitasking.suggestions.lo=It's a fact that the human brain doesn't really multitask. We're more like a one CPU computer, we can only process on item at a time. However, we can slice up our time and attention to create the illusion of multitasking and accomplish several tasks in parallel. And, of course, there are some techniques to make this process more efficient:
sc.150.Multitasking.suggestions.lo.b1=Work on related tasks together. The more related two tasks are, the easier it is for your brain to switch between them. 
sc.150.Multitasking.suggestions.lo.b2=Keep your to-do list in front of you and up-to-date all the time. Don't be afraid to assign or re-assign priorities. 
sc.150.Multitasking.suggestions.lo.b3=Make special time to review information. Shifting between tasks can cause things you read quickly to be less firmly embedded in your memory. If it's an important document, find a way to review it more carefully at a later time. Just add it to the list!
