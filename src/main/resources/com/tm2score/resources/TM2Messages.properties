g.CefrEquivScore=CEFR-Equivalent Score:
g.CefrEquivScoreText=CEFR-Equivalent Summary:
g.CefrPrepNote=CEFR Equivalent Scores: Portions of this assessment were designed to generate scores equivalent to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR), which was established by the Council of Europe and is today a widely-accepted standard for characterizing language proficiency, particularly for use in business or education.  CEFR classifies a candidate into one of 7 levels:  Pre-Beginner (Pre-A1), Beginner (A1), Elementary (A2), Intermediate (b1), Upper Intermediate (B2), Advanced (C1), and Proficient (C2). The CEFR Equivalent scores presented in this report use this scale and show the highest level which the candidate has successfully negotiated (passed). We prepared this assessment using a thoughtful process to map all questions to their respective CEFR levels. Candidates are exposed to questions starting at the lowest level and slowly increasing in difficulty to the highest level. At several points during the assessment the test can be stopped if the candidate has not answered a sufficient number of 'less difficult' questions correctly.
g.CefrPrepNote.2=The CEFR-equivalent portion of this assessment was developed using sources such as the Cambridge Assessment Word Lists and the English Vocabulary Profile. It also went through a series of steps including item writing, peer review, feedback, and multiple revision cycles to ensure the closest possible match to CEFR Standards.

Note that these results should always be used as a part of a balanced candidate selection process that includes independent evaluation steps, such as interviews and reference checks.

g.CT2GraphicAlt=Graphic for score interpretation
g.CT3RptCaveat=Hiring decisions should never be based on a single source of information. The most effective use of this assessment report is as a part of a multi-faceted program of candidate evaluation that includes resume review, interviews, and reference checks.

g.CT3RptCaveatDevel=Always keep in mind that assessments are limited in the amount of information they can gather and the insights they produce. At the same time, it has been shown that assessments like this one can help most people gain insight into their work-related competencies and can help them make adjustments and improvements over time. 

g.CT3RptFbkDisagree=If you disagree with your scores or feedback, please be aware that assessments are based on statistical data collected from a large pool of test takers (usually 100 or more). Your score reflects how your responses compare with the statistical pool used to determine the mean and standard deviation used in the calculations. 

g.CT3RptGraphKey=Most competency scores are norm-based, which means that they can be interpreted in terms of their distance from the average or mean score. For all scales, a score equal to the mean receives a score of 65 and scores above and below this value are set so that a score change of 15 equals one standard deviation. 
g.CT3RptGraphKeyLinear=For linear competencies, higher is better across the entire scale. For these scales a score between 65 and 80 (light green) represents 0 to 1 standard deviation above the mean and a score above 80 (dark green) represents more than one standard deviation above the mean. Similarly, a score of 50 - 65 (yellow) represents 0 to 1 standard deviation below the mean, while a score of 35 - 50 (orange) equates to 1 to 2 standard deviations below the mean, and a score below 35 represents more than 2 standard deviations below the mean. 
g.CT3RptGraphKeyNonlinear=For non-linear competencies, scores in the middle are more desirable. For these scales a score between 50 and 80 (dark green) represents scores that are within 1 standard deviation of the mean, scores between 80 and 95 and scores between 35 and 50 (yellow) represent scores that are 1 to 2 standard deviations above or below the mean, and scores above 95 or below 35 (red) represent scores that are more than 2 standard deviations above or below the mean. 


g.CT3RptGraphKeyFbk=Most competency scores are normative-based, which means that they can be interpreted in terms of their distance from the average or mean score. This makes all scales roughly comparable to one another. Dark green indicates your score is more than one standard deviations above the mean, light green indicates above the mean, yellow means less than one standard deviation below the mean, orange indicates between 1 and 2 standard deviations below the mean, and red means your score was 2 or more standard deviations below the mean. 


g.CT3RiskFactorsHdrTitle=Potential Risk Areas
g.CT3RiskFactorsHdrTitleC=Potential Risk Areas:
g.CT3RiskFactorsHdr=The candidate's responses indicate the following potential risks:
g.CT3RiskFactorsFtr=For additional probing questions, refer to the interview guide below.
g.CT3RiskFactorsFtrEml=Please refer to the PDF score report for recommended probing questions.


g.CT3Risk_AIMSFaking=Irregular response pattern indicates possible faking for personality and behavioral history questions.
g.CT3Risk_LowCitizenship=Low corporate citizenship score could indicate potential for questionable behavior.
g.CT3Risk_UnproductiveBeh=Behavioral history indicates potential unproductive behavior.
g.CT3Risk_Flight=Behavioral history indicates potential for low tenure.
g.CT3Risk_BadAttitude=Low score on Exhibits a Positive Work Attitude could indicate candidate is less likely to support management.
g.CT3Risk_LowSalesDrive=Low competitive score could indicate candidate has less than average sales drive.
g.CT3Risk_LowExpressive=Low Expressive and Outgoing score could indicate candidate may not be comfortable initiating contact with and/or persuading others.
g.CT3Risk_LowRelationships=Low score on Develops Relationships could indicate candidate may not be comfortable working with people.

g.CT3Risk_LowDrive=Low Drive score could indicate potential issues with motivation and focus. 
g.CT3Risk_LowIntegrity=Low Integrity score could indicate potential issues with reliability.  
g.CT3Risk_LowTeamwork=Low Teamwork score could indicate potential collaboration issues.  



#g.CT3Risk_AIMSFaking=Irregular response pattern indicates possible faking for attitudes, interests, and motivations, and behavioral history questions.

g.CT3ComparisonVsOverallNote=Overall vs Percentiles Scores: The overall score reflects the success in the test, based on the mean (average) and standard deviation of the test scores. The percentile score reflects the percentage of test-takers who scored equal or below this overall score. We recommend you use the Overall Score as your primary evaluation criteria. However, percentile scores can often be useful in comparing specific candidates against one another and with a group, such as for test takers in a certain organization or within a certain account.
# g.CT3ComparisonVsOverallNote=Overall vs Percentiles Scores: The overall score is computed to fit a normal distribution of scores from 0 to 100 using a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 21.06. These values were selected to match the Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE) scale developed by the U.S. Department of Education. This approach standardizes scores in a way similar to percentile ranking but preserves the equal-interval properties of a z-score. The report also presents percentile ranks in the Comparison section. These scores are not the same as NCE scores, even though both are presented on a 0-100 scale. The biggest difference is that percentile scores precisely reflect the actual distribution of scores and have not been transformed to produce an equal-interval scale. We recommend you use the Overall Score as your primary evaluation criteria. However, percentile scores can often be useful in comparing specific candidates against one another and with a group, such as for test takers in a certain country or within a certain account.

g.SampleAudioContentKey=Our sampling and reporting capability is a state-of-the-art voice sample collection tool that works worldwide and in nearly 80 languages. Voice samples are collected and stored. All associated reports make the actual voice something an evaluator can listen to at any time. Additionally, most voice samples are converted to text in their spoken language. The text transcript of what was spoken is usually included in the score report. In some cases, these samples are then translated into another language for processing by text-based automated evaluation tools employing machine learning. In other cases, the text is evaluated against a set of expected responses. The voice sample itself can be evaluated for the perceptions it creates in the listener, both positive and negative. 
g.SampleAudioTitleKey=Please talk about the how a person's voice can be perceived differently by different people.

g.ScoreCalculation=Score Calculation Detail

g.ScoreCalculationExplanation=The following table provides a summary of how the overall score was calculated from each of the individual competency scores. First, all competency scores are calculated on a scale of 0-100. Note that some competencies use their color category rather than their actual numeric score in the overall calculation. For these, a standard score associated with the assigned color category is used in the overall score calculation rather than the actual numeric score. This is reflected in the ''Score Value Used'' column. Next, a weighted average of scores is computed using individual competency weights, typically set using job analysis data provided by the US Government Occupational Information Network (O*Net). Next, the weighted average score is converted to a normalized or ''Z'' score with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 using historical mean and standard deviation data for this test, and then transformed to a Normal Curve Equivalent Scale (NCE) which has a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 21.06. Finally outlier scores are adjusted if they are below 1 or above 99. Please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_curve_equivalent for additional information about Normal Curve Equivalent Scales.
g.ScoreCalculationExplanation.zeroto3=The following table provides a summary of how the overall score was calculated from each of the individual competency scores. First, all competency scores are calculated on a scale of 0-3. Note that some competencies use their color category rather than their actual numeric score in the overall calculation. For these, a standard score associated with the assigned color category is used in the overall score calculation rather than the actual numeric score. This is reflected in the ''Score Value Used'' column. Next, a weighted average of scores is computed using individual competency weights, typically set using job analysis data provided by the US Government Occupational Information Network (O*Net). Next, the weighted average score is converted to a normalized or ''Z'' score with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 using historical mean and standard deviation data for this test, and then transformed to a Normal Curve Equivalent Scale (NCE) which has a mean of 1.5 and standard deviation of 0.6318. Finally outlier scores are adjusted if they are below 0 or above 3. Please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_curve_equivalent for additional information about Normal Curve Equivalent Scales.
g.ScoreCalculationExplanation.oneto5=The following table provides a summary of how the overall score was calculated from each of the individual competency scores. First, all competency scores are calculated on a scale of 1-5. Note that some competencies use their color category rather than their actual numeric score in the overall calculation.

This is reflected in the ''Score Value Used'' column. Next, a weighted average of scores is computed using individual competency weights, typically set using job analysis data provided by the US Government Occupational Information Network (O*Net). Next, the weighted average score is converted to a normalized or ''Z'' score with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 using historical mean and standard deviation data for this test, and then transformed to a normal scale (NCE) with a mean of {0} and standard deviation of {1}. Finally outlier scores are adjusted if they are below 1 or above 5.

g.ScoreCalculationExplanationHraZ=The following table provides a summary of how the overall score was calculated from the individual competency scores. Competency scores are calculated on a 0-100 scale by first calculating a Z statistic based on test-taker responses and then transforming the Z value to a scale with target mean and standard deviation. Certain competencies have a normal score distribution where it is best to be closest to the mean. For these competencies we modify the Z statistic by multiplying its absolute value by minus 1 for the overall score calculation.  Next, to calculate the overall score, a weighted average of all modified competency Z statistics is computed and transformed to a score with the same target mean and standard deviation. Finally outlier scores are adjusted if they are below 0 or above 100.
