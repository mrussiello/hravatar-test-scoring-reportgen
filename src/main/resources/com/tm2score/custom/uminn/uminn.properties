pcm.title=Professionalism Competency Model
pcm.1=This report is intended to provide developmental feedback to help you improve your standing on seven key professionalism and interpersonal dimensions that are critical to success as a resident or fellow. These dimensions are shown below.
pcm.2=As this figure illustrates, each professionalism dimension is aligned with several important lower-level facets. In addition, each of the facets is aligned with a set of specific, observable, behaviors. These behaviors are described later in this report.
pcm.3=This model was developed and validated at the University of Minnesota Medical School in a series of workshops with faculty members and Ph.D. educators. The model was validated to ensure the behaviors measured the intended facets and were viewed to be important for successful performance as an independent physician.


fro.title=Feedback Report Overview
fro.1=This report presents two sources of feedback related to the seven professionalism and interpersonal dimensions.  
fro.2=The first source of feedback is a set of scores on each of the seven dimensions. Scores are presented for each dimension on a scale of 1-100. In general, higher scores represent higher expected performance on each dimension.
fro.3=The second source of feedback is a comparison of your responses on the scenarios with those of faculty members and other respondents.

fro.1.altus=This report presents feedback related to the seven professionalism and interpersonal dimensions.

slr.title=Scenario-Level Report

slr.1=For each of the 15 scenarios in the developmental exercise, the report below compares your effectiveness ratings to those of faculty members and other respondents.
slr.2=The report also indicates the action you indicated you would take in each scenario. 

slr.3=As you review your responses, keep in mind that there are no \u201cright\u201d answers to these scenarios, only more effective and less effective ways of responding. 

slr.4=Use these comparisons to reflect on the best ways to approach these types of situations in the future. 

slr.4.1=Where your effectiveness ratings are very different from those of faculty or other respondents, consider why this might be so. 
slr.4.2=If the action you would take in a situation was judged by you to be less effective than other responses, consider why this might be so. For instance, did you say you would perform an action that was less optimal in your eyes due to a specific situational constraint at your institution (e.g., you know the attending at your institution would not be responsive to a suggestion you viewed to be effective)? 

slr.5=The purpose of this section is to provoke thought, reflection, and discussion. Ultimately, the goal is to get you thinking about effective ways to handle these and similar simulations when they arise in the future.
