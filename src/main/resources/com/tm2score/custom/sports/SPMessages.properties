Doubts, on the other hand, can reduce your performance by causing you to push too hard, which results in mistakes, or by forcing you to play more conservatively than you should. Having doubts is entirely normal. Even the highest-performing athletes have them. However, it may be worth asking yourself what is causing you to feel doubts, and what you can do about it? Are you are fully committed to your training? Do you love what you are doing? Do you believe in your talent? If so, then why doubt yourself? \n\nIn addition, you should regularly acknowledge and celebrate even minor achievements and improvements in your game. This will reinforce the fact that your hard work is leading to progress in your performances.
sp.comp.Confidence.qmed.1=Most gaps in confidence are aligned to negative self-talk athletes have with themselves.

Try to actively identify what gives you confidence in competition and replicate those thoughts regularly.

Without confidence, you will play conservatively rather than take appropriate risks. Additionally, when you get behind in a competition, you are more likely to push too hard and make unnecessary mistakes. Finally, your teammates will sense your lack of confidence, which will cause them to feel less confident about themselves and less confident to trust you in pressure situations. \n\nYou need to concentrate on the tactical areas of your game which you can control. Do NOT focus on outcomes like winning or making mistakes. Set some attainable goals in training or a match which align to your strengths and acknowledge regularly when you make a play happen which aligns to your mini-performance goals. \n\nIn addition, regularly acknowledge and celebrate even minor achievements and improvements in your game. This will reinforce the fact that your hard work is leading to progress in your performances.
sp.comp.Confidence.qlow.1=Most gaps in confidence are aligned to negative self-talk athletes have with themselves. You need to identify specific times in practice or matches when you have told yourself "I can't do this". Actively replace a negative thought with the statement "YOU got this!"

sp.comp.Confidence.qlow.5=Think of some events when you experienced doubts during a competition. What caused you to feel that way? How can you replicate behaviors of the most confident athletes?
sp.comp.Confidence.qlow.6=Can you think of any times when you played more conservatively than you should have? Why did you hold back? How can you change behaviors and take more assertive calculated risks? ALWAYS believe in yourself!
